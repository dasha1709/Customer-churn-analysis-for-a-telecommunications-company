# Customer-churn-analysis-for-a-telecommunications-company

## Project Description
The project's goal is to investigate how demographic characteristics, types of services, and duration of use affect the likelihood of churn. The project was implemented in Microsoft Excel using pivot tables, formulas, and visualizations.

## Analysis Objectives
- Determine the overall churn rate;
- Analyze the impact of demographic factors (gender, age, marital status) on churn;
- Investigate the relationship between service types, contracts, and churn;
- Identify risk groups among short-term customers;
- Build visualizations to improve interpretation of results.

## Conclusions
The following key sites were removed from the analysis:
- Customers with monthly contracts have the highest churn rate compared to those with annual or yard contracts.
- Fiber Optic usage is associated with a higher churn rate than DSL.
- New customers (less than 1 year of use) are more likely to be happy to terminate their relationship.
- Retirees and customers without partners have a slightly higher churn rate.
### This suggests that in order to reduce churn, it is worth focusing on loyalty programs for new customers, promoting long-term contracts, and adapting the service for older users.
